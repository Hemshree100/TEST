1. Try all questions on your own
2. DEADLINE IS STRICT              Before - Monday, 6am

There are 10 questions above i expect you to attempt all of them but still attempting above 6 will get a certificate which you can show anywhere and include it in yourr resume!!!
Only those assignments will be considered which will be submitted in the time give! remember no evaluation and certificate after the deadline.
